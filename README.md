# The Dino Game

Final Project for EECS4443 Mobile User Interfaces. <br />

A simple alternative implementation of Googleâ€™s famous browser game, the Dinosaur Game, for Android devices. For this version of the game, there are two input methods the player can choose in the main menu: Voice Input or Touch Input.

It is designed and implemented using Android Studio for our comparative study (Evaluate and Compare the performance of Voice Commands vs Touch Gestures as navigation systems in Android games). <br />
